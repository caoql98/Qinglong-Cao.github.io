## About Me

I'm an AI Ph.D. candidate in the joint program between <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> and <a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo</a>. I am supervised by  Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=31&p=teacher" target="_blank"> Yuntian Chen </a> (belonging to the team of Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?p=teacher&tid=63" target="_blank"> Dongxiao Zhang </a> and guided by Prof.<a href="https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=3&p=teacher" target="_blank"> Shiyi Chen </a>) and Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"> Xiaokang Yang </a>, and I also work closely with  Prof.<a href="https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Chao Ma </a>.

Prior to that, I  received my B.E. and M.S. degrees from <a href="https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Northwestern Polytechnical University</a> respectively in 2019 and 2022, under the supervision of Pro.<a href="https://scholar.google.ae/citations?user=xrqsoesAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"> Junwei Han </a>.  I have broad research interests in data-limited visual learning, including few-shot segmentation, open-vocabulary segmentation, and prompt learning. Recently, my research has involved many computer vision tasks like segmentation, classification, superresolution, generation, remote sensing image processing, and AI for science.
